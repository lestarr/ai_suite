## Our Fully Automated, LLM-Powered Evaluation Solution

Our evaluation system leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically compare extracted data against known ground truth information. This trusted, fully automated process ensures that every piece of gathered information is rigorously validated for accuracy.

**Why It’s Essential:**  
- **Scale Your LLM Solutions:** This evaluation is an absolutely necessary basis to scale any LLM-based solution. It enables rapid experimentation with prompts and other settings by providing quick, objective insights into results and comparisons between different configurations.
- **Format Flexibility:** The formats for the test data and the ground truth can differ significantly. Our system automatically normalizes these inputs, ensuring a fair and accurate evaluation regardless of the source format.

### Key Benefits:
- **Automated Accuracy:** No manual intervention is required — our Evaluator handles all the heavy lifting by semantically comparing each extracted field with the ground truth.
- **Trustworthy Insights:** Detailed error reporting and structured evaluation results provide clear insights into correct matches, missing data, and discrepancies.
- **Versatile Applications:** Whether you’re dealing with financial invoices, complex legal documents, or compliance checks in RAG applications, our solution adapts to your needs. (or we adapt the solution ????)
- **Interactive Visualization:** The evaluation outputs is visualized as interactive dashboards featuring summary metrics, document-level and field-level statistics, and dynamic charts for deeper analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion:** The system accepts both the extracted test data and the corresponding ground truth, even if they come in different formats. Our automatic normalization aligns them for a fair evaluation.
2. **LLM Evaluation:** An LLM compares the fields using semantic matching—ignoring superficial differences such as formatting, citations, or extra metadata.
3. **Structured Results:** The output is a detailed breakdown showing which fields are correct, which are missing, and how closely the test data matches the ground truth.
4. **Visualization:** The results can be rendered as interactive dashboards that allow you to drill down into the details, compare different runs, and identify areas for improvement.

This concise overview demonstrates how our evaluation solution not only ensures high extraction accuracy but also provides a scalable, objective foundation for optimizing LLM solutions. By normalizing diverse data formats automatically and delivering actionable insights through interactive dashboards, we empower you to experiment with and refine your AI-driven data extraction processes with confidence. And by the way, we could set up the automated data extraction as well.
