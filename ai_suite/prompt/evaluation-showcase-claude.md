# LLM Data Extraction Evaluation System

## Business Value Proposition

Our evaluation system provides comprehensive quality assurance for LLM-based data extraction, addressing three critical challenges:

1. **Accuracy Verification**: Ensures extracted data matches source information with semantic understanding
2. **Completeness Checking**: Identifies missing or incomplete information
3. **Consistency Validation**: Maintains data quality across different document types and formats

## Key Capabilities

- **Intelligent Field Mapping**: Automatically matches fields between extracted data and ground truth, even with different naming conventions
- **Complex Data Handling**: Evaluates nested structures, lists, and relationships between fields
- **Multi-language Support**: Works across different languages while maintaining semantic understanding
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides field-level and document-level accuracy metrics

## Use Cases with Results

### 1. Financial Document Processing

**Context**: Automated extraction of transaction details from various financial documents
**Challenge**: High accuracy requirements for financial data with zero tolerance for errors

Results show:

- 100% accuracy for critical fields (transaction IDs, currency)
- 90% accuracy for amount extraction
- Lower accuracy (75-80%) for complex fields like sender/recipient details
- Overall document accuracy ranging from 66.7% to 100%

### 2. Medical Records Analysis

**Context**: Extraction of patient information from diverse medical documents
**Challenge**: Complex medical terminology and critical accuracy requirements

Results demonstrate:

- Perfect accuracy for patient IDs and follow-up dates
- High accuracy (93.3%) for critical fields like lab results and allergies
- Lower accuracy (73.3%) for complex fields like treatment plans
- Document-level accuracy ranging from 62.5% to 100%

### 3. Legal Document Processing

**Context**: Extraction of legal information from various court documents
**Challenge**: Complex legal terminology and structured relationship extraction

Performance metrics:

- 100% accuracy for case numbers and filing dates
- Strong performance (91.7%) on jurisdiction and deadline extraction
- Lower accuracy (66.7%) for complex fields like relief sought
- Document accuracy ranging from 66.7% to 100%
