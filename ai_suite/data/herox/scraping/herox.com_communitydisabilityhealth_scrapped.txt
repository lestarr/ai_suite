Summary

[Overview](https://www.herox.com/communitydisabilityhealth#block-7859) [Guidelines](https://www.herox.com/communitydisabilityhealth#block-7882)

Overview

This is a US-based competition open to non-academic 501(c)3 organizations.

Please read the complete eligibility requirements [here](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=community-disability-health&tab=rules).

This challenge calls upon community groups with experience serving people with disabilities to lead the way in proposing solutions that can reduce health disparities. Community organizations are essential to developing and disseminating interventions that are both effective and sustainable in reducing health disparities for disabled people. This competition is about taking actionable steps to promote health equity for all. The National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, at the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and partners are leveraging this prize competition to support community-led solutions.

In Phase 1, community groups submit innovative proposals to reduce health disparities experienced by disabled people by improving, expanding, diversifying, or amplifying their current programs and offerings. Participating organizations must describe how people with disabilities will be a part of their proposed solutions. Up to 8 organizations will be awarded $25,000 each and advance to Phase 2.

In Phase 2, organizations will have 52 weeks to implement their plan/proposal. During this time, subject matter experts from NIH and National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) at the Administration for Community Living (ACL) will also provide technical assistance in the form of educational webinars and matchmaking events. There will be an opportunity to submit an interim progress report at the halfway point and compete for an additional $7,500 prize each. At the conclusion of Phase 2, organizations should demonstrate how they have enhanced the services and output of their organization. Up to three (3) grand prize winners will be awarded $75,000 each.

Guidelines

Challenge Guidelines 

Over 70 million people in the US have one or more type of disability, which is any condition of the body or mind that makes it more difficult to do certain activities and interact with the world around them. Disabled people often experience health disparities that are avoidable health differences resulting from systemic or interpersonal factors, not due to the disabling condition. Disabled people could live longer, healthier lives if health disparities were eliminated. Disability and health are not synonymous!

There are many types and sources of health disparities and we believe community groups can and are working to address many of them. This competition seeks to reward community groups for their creative ideas to promote healthy habits , increase access to health services and information, and reduce barriers to promoting health for people with disabilities. As expressed in the Disability Rights movement slogan “Nothing about us without us,” it is expected that people with lived experience will be central to the teams and ideas proposed.

Health disparities experienced by people with disabilities can include problems with access, like healthcare information delivered in formats that are not accessible to people with vision or hearing disabilities or medical buildings, diagnostic equipment or treatment facilities that preclude access for a person with disability (PWD). While not an exhaustive list, these are examples of documented health disparities, or barriers to healthy behaviors or health information experienced by the disability community:

Health Care Services

   Receipt of screening and preventive health services, like routine check-ups, reproductive health care, dental care, vaccinations, intimate partner violence screenings and cancer screenings. 
   Participation in smoking cessation programs 
   Communication with health professionals, like ASL interpretation, Braille or large print, and health literacy information (e.g., for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or other cognitive impairments) 
   Availability of accessible clinical spaces and equipment, like wheelchair scales, adjustable height exam tables, adaptive treatment and therapy devices. 

Social Determinants of Health

   Assistance with navigating health insurance options and outpatient or community-based health services 
   Receipt of food and nutrition services 
   Participation in physical activity, including access to adaptive sports equipment and gyms 
   Access to community and recreational opportunities 
   Availability of accessible transportation to health care providers, especially in rural communities  

Access to Assistive Technology

   Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) products 
   White canes 
   Hearing aids 
   Mobility supports like walkers and scooters 

NIH and ACL are looking to the community to help address health disparities experienced by disabled people by reducing barriers and facilitating access to healthy living.

Background 

Disability is defined in different ways depending on context. Common types of disability include Impairments in the following domains\:

   Vision 
   Movement 
   Thinking 
   Remembering 
   Learning 
   Communicating 
   Hearing 
   Mental health 
   Social relationships  

\[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html)

Not all disabilities are visible and people may experience one or more disabilities throughout their life course, separately or overlapping. For the purposes of this challenge, services aimed at improving the health of people with any disability type are welcome. We also alternate the use of person-first and identity-first language throughout these guidelines to acknowledge different preferences of different disability communities.

NIH and ACL are working to reduce health disparities experienced by people with disabilities.

In September 2023, NIH oﬃcially designated people with disabilities as a population that experiences health disparities, which both drew attention to topic and opened funding opportunities for academic research. NIH is addressing health disparities caused by ableism (i.e., the belief that people with disabilities are inferior or inadequate leading to discrimination and social prejudice) in healthcare and clinical research through a variety of traditional academic research projects.  This prize competition seeks to complement these eﬀorts by engaging with and directly supporting initiatives to improve health equity for disabled people conducted by community groups who do not historically receive NIH funding.

The Challenge 

The Community Champions for Disability Health Challenge is an opportunity for community groups to expand their transformative solutions to enhance the health of people with disabilities. This competition empowers organizations to address health disparities through innovative, community-driven initiatives. By participating, organizations compete for substantial cash prizes and gain access to NIH and NIDILRR resources, expert mentorship, and a platform to showcase their impactful work. This challenge is a call to action to create lasting, equitable health improvements and champion the voices and needs of those with disabilities in the health landscape. Join us in making a profound difference and driving health equity forward!

Phase 1 

In Phase 1 of the Community Champions for Disability Health Challenge, community groups are invited to submit detailed proposals that outline their strategies for reducing health disparities among people with disabilities. Participants will introduce their organization and team, providing insights into the communities they serve and the specific health equity issues they aim to address. They will analyze the current state of their engagement with disability communities and propose innovative improvements or expansions to their existing programs.

Solvers are expected to develop comprehensive plans that include clear objectives and methods for implementation, with a strong focus on measurable outcomes. They will describe how they intend to involve individuals with lived experiences of disability in their efforts and how they will assess the impact of their initiatives. Please note that human subject research is not expected for this challenge. The proposals should also highlight the unique aspects of their approach and the potential for significant positive change within their target communities.

The most promising proposals, demonstrating both innovation and feasibility, will be awarded $25,000 each, allowing up to eight organizations to advance to Phase 2, where they will have the opportunity to bring their plans to life and further contribute to health equity for people with disabilities.

Phase 2 

In Phase 2, selected organizations will implement their proposed plans over a 52-week period. During this phase, participants will put their strategies into action, focusing on improving health equity and reducing disparities for people with disabilities. Organizations will receive support through technical assistance, educational webinars, and matchmaking events with subject matter experts from NIH and NIDILRR.

Participants will provide an interim update halfway through the phase, detailing their progress and any preliminary impacts. This update offers the chance to win an additional $7,500 prize. Throughout the implementation period, organizations are expected to track and measure the impact of their initiatives, ensuring they are making significant strides toward their goals.

At the end of Phase 2, organizations will demonstrate how they have enhanced their services and outputs, showcasing the tangible benefits of their efforts. Up to three grand prize winners will be awarded $75,000 each, recognizing their exceptional contributions to advancing health equity for people with disabilities. This phase emphasizes the practical application of innovative ideas and the achievement of measurable improvements in health-related programs.

While it is expected that all Phase I winners will engage in Phase 2, it is not required and teams may disengage from the competition at any time and keep their prize winnings to date.
