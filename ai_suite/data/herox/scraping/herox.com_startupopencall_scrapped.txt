Startup Open Call

Background & Motivation

At HeroX, we believe in the transformative power of innovation and the pivotal role startups play in driving global progress. Our platform has long been a nexus for problem solvers and visionary thinkers, and we're excited to expand this community by launching a new initiative dedicated to supporting startups worldwide.

We've been listening closely to our crowd and have witnessed the remarkable impact that startups can have when given the right opportunities. Startups bring fresh ideas, agility, and a passion for solving complex challenges that align perfectly with our mission. Recognizing this, we're committed to using our platform for good - to help startups find their dream projects and form meaningful partnerships that can accelerate their growth and amplify their impact.

One of the key motivations behind this initiative is the feedback we've received from organizations eager to collaborate with innovative startups. These organizations are seeking fresh perspectives and disruptive technologies but often encounter legal hurdles and organizational stagnation that hinder such partnerships. HeroX aims to bridge this gap by providing a streamlined platform that alleviates these challenges, facilitating smoother, more effective collaborations between startups and enterprises and larger organizations.

The Opportunity

HeroX is thrilled to announce a groundbreaking open call for startups worldwide - a chance to become part of a dynamic community dedicated to driving innovation and solving some of the most pressing challenges of our time. This is more than just a call for submissions; it's an invitation to collaborate, grow, and make a tangible impact on the future.

Startups are powerhouses of innovation, bringing fresh perspectives and agile solutions to complex problems. Through this opportunity, we're seeking visionary startups eager to showcase their ideas, products, and offerings to connect with like-minded innovators and engage with organizations looking for cutting-edge solutions.

What We Offer:

   Global Exposure: Present your startup to a worldwide audience, increasing visibility and opening doors to new markets.
   Collaborative Environment: Engage with a community of innovators, mentors, and industry leaders committed to fostering growth and facilitating meaningful connections.
   Potential Partnerships: Explore opportunities to collaborate with organizations seeking innovative solutions to integrate into their operations.
   Feedback and Insights: Receive valuable input from experts and peers to refine your offerings and accelerate development.

Why Participate?

This opportunity allows you access to resources and networks that can propel your startup to the next level. Whether you're looking to scale your technology, find strategic partners, or simply share your vision with the world, HeroX provides the platform to make it happen.

We are calling on startups across all industries and stages of development (i.e., technical readiness levels). If you have a solution that addresses real-world challenges and the ambition to make a difference, we want to hear from you.

Join Us in Shaping the Future

Innovation doesn't happen in isolation. It thrives in communities where ideas are shared, challenged, and nurtured. HeroX realizes that it already houses the foundation for this community, and we now want to create an ecosystem where startups can grow in the best way for themselves. Together, we can drive progress, disrupt the status quo, and create solutions that have a lasting impact.

Benefits to Participating Startups

Submitting to HeroX's startup initiative offers strategic advantages designed to accelerate your growth and amplify your impact. By participating, your startup gains access to exclusive opportunities to present solutions to organizations actively seeking innovative partners to tackle complex challenges. Collaborations may take various forms, including pilot projects, joint ventures, co-development agreements, or strategic partnerships, allowing you to engage in ways that align best with your business objectives.

HeroX provides a platform for global exposure, showcasing your startup to an exclusive ecosystem consisting of, but not limited to, an international audience of industry leaders, investors, and fellow innovators. This increased visibility can open doors to new markets and opportunities, enhancing your brand recognition and reach. Additionally, you become part of a vibrant community where you can connect directly with established organizations and like-minded entrepreneurs, fostering meaningful relationships that can lead to valuable partnerships and alliances.

Your participation also allows you to influence the future development of our platform. We value the insights and feedback from our startup community, and your contributions will directly impact upcoming enhancements designed to better serve your needs. More on this below...

Moreover, you will receive professional insights and support from industry experts and potential partners. Constructive feedback helps refine your solutions and improve market readiness, while access to HeroX's resources and community discussions offers valuable perspectives on best practices, market trends, and technological advancements.

Participation in future events, such as pitch sessions, showcases, and conferences, allows you to present your solutions to a curated audience of industry stakeholders, further enhancing your network and prospects.

Aligning with HeroX also enhances your credibility with potential partners and investors. Association with a platform known for innovation and collaboration underscores your commitment to excellence and forward-thinking. Additionally, there may be opportunities to be featured in case studies and success stories, highlighting your achievements to a broader audience.

Enhancement to the HeroX Platform

Learning from our Startups

By gathering insights from participating startups, we aim to understand your needs more deeply. This collaborative approach ensures that the platform evolves in ways that directly benefit you. To help you present your startup effectively, we're developing enhanced profile features that allow you to showcase Technological Readiness Level (TRL), your organization's objectives and goals, and your partnership interests. In the future, these will be a part of your organization's HeroX profile. For this opportunity, and to help us learn how best to build them out, they are a part of the intake form, or the submission form for this open call.

Improved Search and Matchmaking

Leveraging the detailed information from enhanced profiles, we're refining our search and matchmaking: Our goal is to create a dynamic ecosystem where the right connections happen naturally, accelerating innovation and growth for all participants. Our stronger search and matchmaking will allow all involved to:

   Facilitate more effective partnerships by matching startups with organizations seeking specific solutions or technologies;
   Find and connect with others working in complementary areas, opening doors for collaboration and knowledge sharing, and;
   Find skilled individuals within the HeroX community who can contribute to their teams.

By improving how organizations discover and engage with startups, we're addressing a critical need expressed by organizations eager to collaborate with innovative companies like yours. These enhancements reduce barriers, streamline communication, and create more opportunities for successful partnerships. We believe that the best way to build a platform that serves you is by involving you in the process. Your feedback and insights are invaluable as we implement these features. Together, we'll create a user-centric environment that not only meets your current needs but also adapts to the evolving landscape of innovation.

Join Us!

Once logged in, you'll find a startup submission form thoughtfully organized to help us understand your venture comprehensively. You'll start with essential details about your company and introduce your core team members and their roles, giving us insight into the expertise that drives your startup.
