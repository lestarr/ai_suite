Summary

[Overview](https://www.herox.com/NASASouthPoleSafety#block-7947) [Guidelines](https://www.herox.com/NASASouthPoleSafety#block-7948)

Overview

In the unforgiving lunar environment, the possibility of an astronaut crewmember becoming incapacitated due to unforeseen circumstances (injury, medical emergency, or a mission-related accident) is a critical concern, starting with the upcoming Artemis III mission, where two astronaut crewmembers will explore the Lunar South Pole. The Moon's surface is littered with rocks ranging from 0.15 to 20 meters in diameter and craters spanning 1 to 30 meters wide, making navigation challenging even under optimal conditions. The low gravity, unique lighting conditions, extreme temperatures, and availability of only one person to perform the rescue, further complicate any rescue efforts.

Among the critical concerns is the safety of astronauts during Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). If an astronaut crewmember becomes incapacitated during a mission, the ability to return them safely and promptly to the human landing system is essential. A single crew member should be able to transport an incapacitated crew member distances up to 2 km and a slope of up to 20 degrees on the lunar terrain without the assistance of a lunar rover.

This pressing issue opens the door for innovative solutions. We are looking for a cutting-edge design that is low in mass and easy to deploy, enabling one astronaut crewmember to safely transport their suited (343 kg (~755lb)) and fully incapacitated partner back to the human landing system. The solution must perform effectively in the Moon’s extreme South Pole environment and operate independently of a lunar rover.

Your creativity and expertise could bridge this critical gap, enhancing the safety measures for future lunar explorers. By addressing this challenge, you have the opportunity to contribute to the next “giant leap” in human space exploration.

Guidelines

Background

NASA’s Artemis campaign marks a new chapter in lunar exploration, aiming to land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner crewmember at the Lunar South Pole. Artemis III, scheduled for no earlier than 2026, is the first crewed surface mission under this campaign. The objectives of Artemis III are to conduct experiments and collect samples to advance our understanding of lunar geology and resources, test new technologies and systems that will enable a long-term human presence on the Moon and gather data to support subsequent missions.

This ambitious endeavor presents significant challenges. Unlike future missions that will be equipped with a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (scheduled for delivery no earlier than Artemis V) and Pressurized Rover (scheduled for delivery no earlier than Artemis VII), the Artemis III and IV crews will not have access to a rover. This limitation necessitates that all equipment and safety protocols be carried and managed by the crewmembers themselves, emphasizing the need for solutions with minimal mass and volume impact.

The Spacesuit

For the Artemis III mission, crewmembers will be equipped with the next-generation Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit, developed by Axiom Space. This advanced suit represents a significant leap forward in spacesuit technology, designed to support the demanding objectives of lunar exploration at the Moon’s South Pole.

The AxEMU serves as a personal spacecraft for each EVA crewmember, providing a flexible, adjustable fit and life-sustaining environment amidst the vacuum of space and the Moon’s harsh conditions. The suit’s life support system is engineered for extended missions, featuring regenerable carbon dioxide scrubbing and robust thermal regulation. This system enables crewmembers to conduct spacewalks for durations of 4-8 hours. The Artemis missions currently expect 2-5 EVAs of this duration, each.  The AxEMU suit is outfitted with four attachment points located on the front waist area and top of the Spacesuit. (See Axiom Suit Images in the [Resources tab](https://www.herox.com/NASASouthPoleSafety/resource/2106) for additional details)

The Lunar Environment

The Lunar South Pole presents an environment of stark extremes and formidable challenges, shaping every aspect of the Artemis missions. Understanding this environment is crucial for ensuring the safety of the crewmembers and the success of their objectives. Temperature extremes are among the most significant challenges. Due to the Moon’s lack of atmosphere and minimal axial tilt, temperatures can vary dramatically. Sunlit areas can reach scorching highs of approximately 130°F (54°C), while areas in permanent shadow can plunge to frigid lows of about \-334°F (-203°C). Equipment and suits must be able to operate effectively across this vast temperature range, and thermal regulation for crewmembers is a constant challenge.

Lighting conditions at the South Pole are uniquely challenging. The Sun hovers near the horizon, creating long shadows that obscure surface features and make terrain navigation difficult. Some regions are in near-permanent darkness, while others experience extended periods of daylight. The low-angle lighting can impair depth perception, increasing the risk of tripping or stumbling over unseen obstacles.

The terrain itself is rugged and uneven, characterized by a multitude of geological features, including:

   Rocks (Blocks): The surface is strewn with rocks ranging from approximately 0.15 meters to 20 meters in diameter, with a height-to-diameter ratio of 0.5. These blocks can impede movement and create hazardous conditions for traversal.
   Craters: Craters vary in size from 1 meter to 30 meters in diameter, with a depth-to-diameter ratio of 0.12. Navigating around or across these craters requires careful planning and significant physical effort.
   Slopes: up to 20 degrees (up, down, or cross slopes)

(See Design Specification for Natural Environments (DSNE) in the [Resources tab](https://www.herox.com/NASASouthPoleSafety/resource/2105) for additional details)

Lunar gravity: Approximately one-sixth that of Earth’s, the Moon’s gravitational pull affects how crewmembers move and handle objects. While the reduced gravity allows for lifting heavier loads than on Earth, it also means that inertia is a concern; once an object is in motion, it is harder to stop, impacting both walking and the manipulation of tools and equipment. Regolith, or lunar dust, is composed of fine, sharp particles that can cling to surfaces due to electrostatic charging. It can interfere with equipment functionality, degrade seals and joints, and pose safety and health risks (if ingested or inhaled) – though spacesuits are designed to minimize exposure. The Moon’s lack of an atmosphere exposes the surface to solar radiation and the threat of micrometeoroid impacts.

These environmental factors necessitate strong consideration for equipment materials, crewmember transport and use, deployment and operational procedures, and system durability.

Lunar Surface Extravehicular Activities (EVAs)

EVAs are pivotal for scientific discovery, technological advancement, and paving the way for sustained human presence on the Moon. Lunar spacewalks will enable the crew to explore the Lunar South Pole, a region of immense scientific interest due to its unique environmental conditions and the potential presence of water ice in permanently shadowed regions.

The mission will involve a multi-day journey to lunar orbit, followed by a descent to the Moon’s surface near the South Pole – a region unexplored by humans to date. During their mission, crewmembers will conduct EVAs, venturing up to 2 kilometers away from their landing site to explore and conduct scientific research.

“Consumables” in the context of a lunar EVA refer to the limited life support resources  crewmember carries in their spacesuit. These resources include oxygen for breathing, water for cooling, and power for the suit’s systems, such as communication and life support. Consumables are essential to maintaining the crewmember’s ability to survive and function throughout the entire lunar EVA. The amount of consumables carried is designed to support the crewmember for a specific duration, with a contingency reserve for emergencies.

During early Artemis missions, there will only be two crewmembers on the surface of the Moon. Safety protocols dictate that all EVAs be performed with two crewmembers, working closely together. This requirement ensures mutual support and increases safety in the challenging lunar environment. However, it also presents a critical challenge: in the event that one crewmember becomes incapacitated due to injury, medical emergency, or equipment malfunction, the other must be prepared to assist and, if necessary, transport their partner back to the human landing system.

The Problem

The Lunar South Pole poses formidable challenges: treacherous terrain strewn with rocks and craters, extreme temperature fluctuations, unique lighting conditions, and the reduced gravity of the Moon. In this harsh environment, the possibility of a crewmember becoming incapacitated due to injury, health issues, or equipment failure is a serious concern.

Artemis explorers would benefit from a lightweight, easily deployable solution that allows a single crewmember to transport a 343 kg (~755lb)  fully incapacitated crewmember over distances of up to 2 kilometers (and lunar terrain slopes up to 20 degrees) without the assistance of a lunar rover.

We are seeking innovative solutions to this challenge. By developing a design that is low in mass, easily transportable by the crewmember throughout the duration of the nominal EVA, easy to deploy, and capable of functioning effectively under the extreme conditions of the Lunar South Pole, you can play a vital role in enhancing the safety measures for our future lunar explorers.
