# Information Extraction Pipeline Enhancement Discussion

## Current Pipeline

- Well-structured modular pipeline with ContentScraperAgent, URLJinaAgent, ExtractionAgent, and FormatResultsAgent
- Clean architecture with error handling, caching, and resource management
- Linear flow with clear responsibilities

## Challenge

Need to handle incomplete information extraction by mimicking human-like exploration behavior:

- Detect missing information
- Find and follow relevant links
- Extract additional data
- Integrate findings

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Evaluation System

- EvaluationAgent to analyze extracted fields
- Field status tracking (correct, wrong, not extracted)
- Confidence scoring and validation
- Explanation generation for decisions

### 2. Smart Exploration Approaches

a) **Staged Extraction Pattern**

- Multiple passes with increasing depth
- Targeted extraction for missing fields
- Maintains linear flow

b) **Field Dependencies Graph**

- Model relationships between fields
- Guide exploration based on known patterns
- Efficient sub-pipeline creation

c) **Progressive Enhancement**

- Core fields first
- Incremental improvement
- Confidence tracking

### 3. LLM-Guided Exploration

Using LLM as the "brain" to:

- Evaluate information completeness
- Guide link selection
- Maintain context and exploration history
- Make intelligent decisions about further exploration

### Key Considerations

1. **Maintain Simplicity**

   - Avoid complex recursion
   - Clear boundaries
   - Predictable behavior

2. **State Management**

   - Track exploration progress
   - Cache partial results
   - Manage relationships between findings

3. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Smart caching
   - Configurable exploration depth
   - Cost/benefit analysis for additional scraping

## Next Steps

1. Design EvaluationAgent interface
2. Implement LLM-guided exploration logic
3. Enhance state management
4. Create field resolution strategies
5. Develop integration mechanism for findings

## Open Questions

- Optimal depth limitation strategy
- State persistence approach
- Recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization methods

This discussion serves as a foundation for implementing intelligent, human-like information gathering while maintaining system elegance and maintainability.

## Proposed Design

### 1. Assessment Phase

- Take existing extraction result
- Use LLM to evaluate fields that are None/Bad
- Simple prompt-based evaluation
- Output clear list of fields needing improvement
- No complex importance hierarchies needed

### 2. Link Discovery & Evaluation

- Work with content from initial extraction
- Use LLM to identify promising links for missing information
- Example prompt: "Which links might contain information about {missing_field}?"
- Focus on same-page context first

### 3. Targeted Extraction

- Reuse existing pipeline architecture
- Use smaller, field-specific models instead of full models
- Example: PrizePool model instead of complete ChallengeDetails
- Maintain same linear flow as main pipeline

### Key Insight: Field-Guided Exploration

- Field names themselves guide the entire process:
  1. Act as semantic guides for URL exploration (e.g., "prize_pool" suggests following links containing "prize", "award", "reward")
  2. Map directly to sub-models from original extraction model (e.g., PrizePool from ChallengeDetails)
  3. Serve as natural keys for organizing and integrating found information
- This creates a natural, self-guiding system where:
  - The missing information tells us where to look
  - The field structure tells us what to extract
  - The model hierarchy provides ready-made extraction templates

### 4. Simple Integration Strategy

- Basic merge approaches:
  - KeepFirst: Preserve original non-None values
  - KeepLast: Update with new values if found
- Only update previously None/Bad fields
- No complex conflict resolution
- Clear audit trail of updates

### Benefits

- Maintains pipeline simplicity
- Reuses existing components
- Clear, linear processing flow
- Natural LLM-guided exploration
- Minimal additional complexity

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Field Analysis Component
- Extract field metadata from Pydantic models
- Build field-to-submodel mapping
- Create semantic search patterns for each field

### 2. LLM Prompting Strategy
- Field evaluation prompt: "Analyze these fields: {fields}. Which are missing or inadequate?"
- URL discovery prompt: "Given field '{field_name}', which of these links might contain {semantic_patterns}?"
- Content relevance prompt: "Does this content contain information about {field_description}?"

### 3. Pipeline Extension
- Add EvaluationAgent after main extraction
- Implement field-by-field exploration loop
- Maintain original pipeline architecture
- Track exploration depth per field

### 4. Integration Points
- Hook into existing pipeline after ExtractionAgent
- Use existing caching mechanisms
- Leverage current error handling
- Extend InfoModel for tracking sub-extractions

### Example Flow
```python
# Conceptual flow (not actual code)
1. main_extraction = pipeline.run(url)
2. missing_fields = evaluation_agent.analyze(main_extraction)
3. for field in missing_fields:
    - relevant_links = url_discovery_agent.find_links(field)
    - field_model = get_submodel_for_field(field)
    - field_value = mini_pipeline.run(links, field_model)
    - main_extraction.update_field(field, field_value)
```
